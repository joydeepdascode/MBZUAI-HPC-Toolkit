# MBZUAI-HPC-Toolkit

This guide is your essential resource for efficiently developing and scaling your research projectsâ€”from local testing to high-performance execution on the cluster. Mastering this workflow is critical for tackling large-scale Embodied AI and Computer Vision problems championed by faculty like Professor Ian Reid.

## Core Toolkit Sections
This guide covers the crucial steps for robust, reproducible AI research:

1. Containerization Toolkit (Docker & Apptainer): Learn how to package your code and dependencies into portable containers to ensure 100% reproducibility across all environments. We detail the local Docker build process and the secure conversion to Apptainer (Singularity) for cluster usage.

2. HPC Job Scheduling (SLURM): Master the SLURM Workload Manager to efficiently request and utilize GPU and CPU resources. Includes best practices, job templates, and a customizable SLURM Script Generator to save you time.

3. Linux Admin & Basics: Essential commands and concepts for navigating the cluster environment, managing file permissions, and utilizing network storage effectively.

4. Bash Scripting Guide: A practical primer on writing powerful automation scripts to manage your data, run complex job arrays, and orchestrate multi-step experiments.


## Why This Matters
This standardized workflow allows students and faculty to rapidly iterate locally and seamlessly scale experiments globally, accelerating the pace of AI discovery at MBZUAI.
